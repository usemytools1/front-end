<b>Use My Tools</b>

This app gives users the ability to share and borrow tools.

<b>Motivation</b>

We love libraries because of the abiltiy to just borrow books and return them. Sometimes you may need a tool just once. With our app you will have the ablity to borrow the tool you need for the job. 

<b>Tech/framework used</b>

React, Redux, Reactstrap


<b>How to use?</b>

Register with a username and password. If you have tools you would like to loan, you can easily add them. If you need a tool check out the catalog and see if there is one avaliable.
